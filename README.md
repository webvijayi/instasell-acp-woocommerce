Enable the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) for any WooCommerce store, allowing "Buy it in ChatGPT" functionality.

## Description

This plugin enables any WooCommerce-powered website to participate in the **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)**â€”the open standard that powers **"Buy it in ChatGPT" and other AI agent-driven checkouts**.

### Key Features

*   **Turns Your Store Into an AI-Ready Merchant:** Creates all the REST API endpoints required by the ACP, generates a machine-readable product feed, and handles the entire checkout process.
*   **Connects Directly With ChatGPT:** Your products can be surfaced in ChatGPT search results, and users can complete purchases natively within the chat experience.
*   **Secure, PCI-Compliant Commerce:** Utilizes Stripe's secure tokenization for payments, ensuring that sensitive data is handled safely.
*   **Easy Integration:** Works seamlessly with your existing WooCommerce setup with minimal configuration.

### About ACP

The Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) is an open standard that allows AI agents to interact with e-commerce platforms. This plugin is an independent implementation of the ACP specification, developed by Web Vijayi (founded by Lokesh Motwani), and is not officially affiliated with OpenAI, Stripe, or WooCommerce.
