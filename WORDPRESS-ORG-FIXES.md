# WordPress.org Plugin Check Fixes

## Summary
All WordPress.org plugin check errors and warnings have been resolved. The plugin is now ready for submission.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Missing Translators Comments (ERRORS - Fixed)
**Files:** `includes/class-wcacp-admin.php`

**Issue:** Functions with placeholders in translatable strings need translator comments.

**Fix:** Added `/* translators: ... */` comments above all `printf()` and `sprintf()` calls with placeholders at lines:
- Line 181 (OpenAI ACP documentation URL)
- Line 197 (OpenAI ACP application page URL)
- Line 220 (Plugin settings page URL - OpenAI key)
- Line 232 (Plugin settings page URL - Stripe key)
- Line 241 (Plugin documentation URL)

### 2. Development Function Usage (WARNING - Fixed)
**File:** `woocommerce-acp-instant-checkout.php`

**Issue:** `error_log()` found at line 180 - debug code should not be in production.

**Fix:** 
- Added proper conditional checks for `WP_DEBUG_LOG`
- Added phpcs ignore comment with explanation
- Ensured logging only occurs when explicitly enabled via WordPress debug settings

### 3. Direct Database Queries (WARNINGS - Fixed)
**File:** `includes/class-wcacp-product-feed.php`

**Issue:** Direct database queries without caching at lines 223 and 230.

**Fix:**
- Added wp_cache integration for transient key tracking
- Added phpcs ignore comments with justification (bulk deletion of transients)
- Improved cache clearing logic to use WordPress cache API where applicable

### 4. Trademark Term Violations (WARNINGS - Fixed)
**Files:** `woocommerce-acp-instant-checkout.php`, `readme.txt`

**Issue:** 
- Plugin name contained "WooCommerce" not at the end
- Plugin slug contained "woocommerce" not at the end

**Fix:**
- Changed plugin name from "ACP Instant Checkout for ChatGPT & WooCommerce" to "ACP Instant Checkout for WooCommerce"
- Updated description to remove redundant "WooCommerce" references
- Removed "woocommerce" from tags in readme.txt (replaced with more specific tags)
- Updated all references throughout documentation

### 5. Missing composer.json (WARNING - Fixed)
**Files:** `.distignore`, `build-exclude.txt`

**Issue:** composer.json was excluded from distribution but vendor directory was included.

**Fix:**
- Removed `composer.json` and `composer.lock` from `.distignore`
- Removed `composer.json` and `composer.lock` from `build-exclude.txt`
- Added other development files to exclusion lists for cleaner distribution
- WordPress.org requires composer.json when vendor directory is present
